# FindingNemo

## Initial Plan 🌊 
So was inspired by the Bee movie challenge and wanted to try my own twist. I wanted play around and see how many times the name Nemo is said in the the succesful Disney film "Finding Nemo". Using a csv that contained the entire scripet of FindingNemo with one column stating which characters are speaking and the lines column is what the actual dialogue is. 
Credit for the csv can goes to ASH TRINDADE at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashtrindade/finding-nemo-movie-script

## New Goals 🦈 
New goals for this little project is to next make a chart with characters that said Nemo from the most to least (probably Marlin the most since he is Nemo's father) and which character had the most lines in the entire film (again my bet is Marlin having the most lines but maybe Dory as she is a talkactive character).
